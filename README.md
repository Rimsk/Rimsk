## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”¬ Bioinformatician | Data Scientist | Computational Biologist | Clinical Data Analyst | Biostatististician

I am a bioinformatician with 10+ years of experience in genomics, transcriptomics, and computational biology, focused on leveraging big data to solve complex biological questions. With a strong foundation in genomic data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning, I specialize in Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), single-cell RNA-seq, GeomaX, Spatial Transcriptomic and multi-omics data integration.

ðŸ”§ Technical Skills:

	Programming: Python, R, Bash, SQL
	Data Analysis: RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, WGS, GWAS
	Tools & Libraries: DESeq2, edgeR, STAR, HISAT2, GATK, Seurat, PyTorch, TensorFlow
	Tech Stack: Docker, Nextflow, SLURM, Git
	Platforms: AWS, GCP, Linux

 
ðŸ§  Research Interests:

	Single-cell genomics
	Multi-omics integration
	AI/ML in computational biology
	Biomarker discovery
	Personalized medicine
 	Spatial Transcriptomics



 
ðŸŒ± I am passionate about open-source bioinformatics tools, reproducible research, and building pipelines that make complex bioinformatics analysis accessible to both researchers and clinicians. Currently, I am exploring deep learning approaches for predictive modeling in genomic data.
